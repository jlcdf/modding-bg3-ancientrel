It is said that he could throw a spear to the very top of a long oak tree and pierce its tip with the point. One day a royal herald came to the village, announcing a great tournament where the finest masters of arms would gather to compete for the right to become the crown prince's squire. Long may it be, short may it be, Gondo made his way to this great tournament. But already in town after submitting his bid, he learned that the tournament had been bought by a councillor who planned to promote his son as squire by rigging the rules of the tournament so that the masters would get the worst weapons for them. Gondo realised that he would most likely be screwed by the bow competition - so he decided to resort to trickery himself. He bought an enchantment from a local wizard and crafted a bow that would be very accurate and very powerful. However, Gondo's cunning was discovered by a councillor, who, through intrigue, had the master executed, and the enchanted bow ended up in the royal treasury.</content>

King Sinnicus I commanded to get rid of the poachers, and the ringleader was to be quartered for the fun of the crowd. The "hunt for hunters" did not last long, as the guards simply drove trained wild boars into the lands and caught a couple of poachers in the act. A few hours of horrific tortures and the bandits gave away the base of their associates. The poachers' possessions, including this magic bow, were given to the Guard for their ingenuity in catching the criminals.</content>

And many warriors went to this monk because they knew that he possessed the secret heavenly practices of taming thunder and other heavenly forces. But the monk rejected these warriors, because mortals should not know the secrets of heaven. One of the barbarians of the Olaine clan took offence and with the help of a warlock brought a curse on the monk, which forced him to come down to civilisation for treatment. Here the warlock was waiting for him, having brutally sacrificed the monk and imprisoned his soul in a cursed vessel. A piece of the enlightened monk's soul also went to the offended warrior, who used it to saturate his bow.</content>

Swirls of tarnished gold adorn its surface, whispering of forgotten rituals and sorcerous pacts. Legends proclaim that the Nightshield was created by a desperate civilization, faced with oblivion. Teetering on the brink of catastrophe, they struck a desperate bargain with an entity dwelling in the black depths of the cosmos - the Black Star. It was the slumbering deity of night and oblivion, offering them the great artifact in exchange for the growing darkness in their souls. But will it grant you victory in the face of impending defeat, or will the Black Star claim you entirely when the time comes to settle the debt?</content>

According to the dusty chronicles of the Sword Coast's warrior-smiths, such weapons were once crafted for the champions of Tempus, blessed to enhance the natural might of those deemed worthy to wield them. The axe's simple yet profound enchantment suggests it was created during the Age of Humanity, when magic was often woven with elegance rather than extravagance.</content>

Your research in the archives of a long-abandoned mage tower suggests this weapon was part of a larger experiment in harnessing natural electricity. The creator's notes, though mostly destroyed by water damage, hint at an attempt to create weapons for an elite guard stationed in the Stormhorns. You notice intricate runes etched along its haft, designed to channel and amplify electrical energies from the ground up - though their full potential seems to awaken only when standing where lightning has struck.</content>

This broken weapon, it seems, belonged to a renowned herder who was repeatedly polymorphed into a sheep by a mischievous archmage. Rather than break under the humiliation, the shepherd somehow turned these transformations into a source of vengeful power. The pike's blade carries faint etchings of sheep's wool patterns, though whether these were added as decoration or mockery remains unclear. The peak itself shimmers with bright peach flashes and is already more of an etheric artifact than an ordinary trinket of the Material Plane.</content>

The writer describes how the weapon began "collecting" the souls of those it slew, growing more demanding with each execution. The more you study its cruel edges, the more you sense the trapped spirits within - their whispers promise power, but at a terrible price. In your research, you uncover that the axe was forged in a forgotten ritual involving a possessed headsman's blade and the remnants of a necromancer's staff. The marriage of these dark artifacts created something hungry, something that feeds not just on death, but on the very essence of its victims.</content>

The spear's unusually sharp tip, you notice, never seems to gather frost despite its perpetual coldness. A partially preserved scroll suggests this was the favored weapon of the tribunal's executioner, who believed that true justice, like the harshest winter, should strike twice - first with the blade, then with the cold. The rest of the scroll has been damaged by time, leaving the fate of both executioner and tribunal shrouded in mystery.</content>

The weapon's distinctive head bears geometric patterns that match no earthly design - instead resembling the abstract forms that float in the silver void between realities. Most intriguing is a note describing how these artifacts were used by the githyanki's solitary scouts, who drew power from the absolute solitude of astral space. The weapon's purpose in reaching the Material Plane remains unknown, though its affinity for isolation persists.</content>

A dusty journal from Candlekeep's restricted section tells of Sister Moira, a cleric of Mask who grew disillusioned with traditional temple worship. She crafted this staff in the sewers beneath Baldur's Gate, infusing it with shadow essence during the longest night of the year. According to the journal, Moira used it to infiltrate and spy upon other temples, believing that divine wisdom lay in understanding the secrets of both the holy and the profane. The last entry mentions her departure to the Cloakwood - though whether she found her answers in those dark woods, none can say.</content>

The crystalline head appears to be a modified spell battery, its runes precisely calibrated to convert the energy of a deadly strike into pure magical potential. According to Drugan's last notes, he never fully stabilized the conversion process - the hammer would occasionally overload, causing "interesting" magical accidents, tearing the fabric of the Weave.

While the Order itself was thought lost during the Great Purge of the elder brain Xax'tal'han, their weapons were said to be scattered across Faerûn, waiting for new champions to take up their ancient cause.</content>

The few texts that dare mention it speak only in terrified whispers of the Dark One, a deity so obscure that even its name has been lost to time. You've noticed that the weapon seems to act of its own accord at times, choosing its victims with an intelligence that no mere enchanted blade should possess. Perhaps most disturbing is the realization that you're not truly its wielder, but merely its temporary vessel.</content>

Now this dreadful trophy rests in your hands - unnaturally cold, its runes pulsing with sickly green light.

Even liches and ancient vampires fear this weapon, for it carries within it a fragment of Death's own power.</content>

Through arcane geometry and principles long lost, he imbued his blades with an almost sentient balance. The sword's peculiar crossguard, you notice, seems to guide your hand after each swing, as if the blade itself yearns to find its mark.

Now this ancient maul weeps radiance from its wounds, each mark of corruption blazing with heaven's own light, as if the very stars themselves weep for its wielder's fate.

During the time of the Astral Confluence, when the silver void danced with unprecedented power, K'rax discovered the means to capture the very essence of collapsing astral pools, binding their otherworldly might into weapons of singular purpose. As you hold it, you observe how its crystalline components bend light like ripples in a still pond, and in the deepest darkness, tiny motes of silvered light dance about its limbs like stars in a miniature firmament. The whereabouts of its creator and its sister weapons remain shrouded in mystery, whispered only in legends of the Great Astral Void.</content>

These weapons were wrought beneath ancient stars, each blade capturing heaven's light within its crystalline patterns, shimmering like the crown of creation itself. Not tools of bloodshed, but instruments of transformation - for the emperor sought to win kingdoms through wisdom rather than war. The weapon's edge glimmers with enchantments most sublime, capable of turning the fiercest foe into the most steadfast ally. Of these seven legendary axes, but three survived the empire's fall, each writing its own tale of bloodless victories that shaped the very face of history.</content>

Yet where others sought to break their chains, she yearned to forge them anew. In the sacred forges of Lantan, beneath the watchful eyes of master artificers, she bound her cursed essence to steel and shadow. The hammer's face bears curse-marks wrought in reverse, each line a testament to her mastery over malevolent forces. Though the lady's fate lies lost to time, her creation endures - a beacon to those who would transform their darkness into divine purpose.</content>
